# Bioinformatics-Analysis-Pipeline
Automated DNA sequence cleaning and proteomic analysis pipeline using Biopython."
## About
This project demonstrates a basic bioinformatics pipeline using Python and Biopython
to process DNA sequences and perform simple protein sequence analysis.

## Workflow
- Input DNA sequence in FASTA format
- Sequence cleaning
- Translation into protein sequence
- Output generation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Biopython

## Future Scope
This pipeline can be extended for advanced sequence analysis and real-world
biotechnology applications.
