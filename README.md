Genomic Data Analysis Pipeline (v1.0.0)
​Bridging Molecular Biology and Computational Efficiency
​🧬 Project Overview
​This repository contains a Python-based pipeline designed for the automated processing and analysis of genomic sequences. As part of my journey toward the MPhil in Bioscience Enterprise at the University of Cambridge, I am developing this tool to understand the technical challenges of handling large-scale genomic data—a critical skill for leadership in the biotech industry.
​🛠 Features
​FASTA Parsing: Efficiently reads and processes standard genomic sequence formats.
​Base Composition Analysis: Calculates the frequency of Nucleotides (A, C, T, G) to determine sequence characteristics.
​GC-Content Calculation: A vital metric for understanding DNA stability and gene density, essential for PCR and primer design in industrial biotech applications.
​📂 Repository Structure
​/scripts: Contains the core Python logic for sequence analysis.
​/data: Includes sample genomic data (e.g., Enterobacteria phage lambda) used for pipeline validation.
